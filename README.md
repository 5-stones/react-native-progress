# react-native-progress

Progress indicators and spinners for React Native using ReactART. 

![progress-demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/10870073/65c13a66-808f-11e5-863b-b9f2134fa3c6.gif)

**Note: Full android support will come when ReactART is ported to android.**

## Installation

`$ npm install react-native-progress --save`

### ReactART based components

`$ npm install art --save`

To use the `Pie` or `Circle` components, you need to include the ART library in your project. To do this, simply add the `ART.xcodeproj` (found in `node_modules/react-native/Libraries/ART`) to the **Libraries** group and add `libART.a` to **Link Binary With Libraries** under **Build Phases**. [More info and screenshots about how to do this is available in the React Native documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).

Until [this pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/3308) to expose ReactART as a public API is merged, you will need to polyfill this because of packager limitations. Simply inject this code before requiring this module: 

```js
if(!React.ART) {
  React.ART = require('ReactNativeART');
}
```

## Usage

*Note: If you don't want the ReactART based components and it's dependencies, do a deep require instead: `var ProgressBar = require('react-native-progress/Bar');`.*

```js
var Progress = require('react-native-progress');

<Progress.Bar progress={0.3} width={200} />
<Progress.Pie progress={0.4} size={50} />
<Progress.Circle size={30} indeterminate={true} />
```
